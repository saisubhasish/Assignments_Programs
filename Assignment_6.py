# 1.  An escape character is a backslash \ followed by a character which give some special functionality to the
# character in string. We use them to provide tab space, move cursor to newline and for carriage return.

# 7.  The values of the following expressions
#     'Hello'.upper() # HELLO
#     'Hello'.upper().isupper() # True
#     'Hello'.upper().lower() # hello


# 8.  'Remember, remember, the fifth of July.'.split() # ['Remember,', 'remember,', 'the', 'fifth', 'of', 'July.']
