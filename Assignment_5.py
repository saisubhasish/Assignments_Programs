# 3. In list insertion order is preserved. But in dict insertion order is not preserved.
#    We access list elements through it's index value. But we access dict values through it's keys.


# 4. If we try to access spam['foo'] where spam is {'bar': 100}, we will get  KeyError: 'foo'


# 5. If a dictionary is stored in spam, the expressions 'cat' in spam checks the value if present in keys and 'cat' in
#    spam.keys() checks the value if present in keys of dict.


# 6. If a dictionary is stored in spam, the expressions 'cat' in spam checks the value if present in keys and 'cat' in
#    spam.values() checks the value if present in values of dict.


# 7. The shortcut key is - spam.setdefault('color', 'black')

# 8. Within the pprint module there is a function with the same name pprint(), which is used to pretty-print the given
